# This is done to take advantage of Docker's layer caching.

# In this Dockerfile, Nginx serves the static files generated by npm run build. 
# The nginx:1.20-alpine image listens on port 80 by default. 
# To access the app from outside the Docker container, you'd map a port from your host to port 80 in the container 
# using Docker's -p or within a docker-compose.yml file. This mapping makes your app accessible at the specified host port, 
# routing through Nginx inside the container.
